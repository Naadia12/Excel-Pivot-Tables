Average mean temperatures will be looked at. This will show how the weather changes over a period over time. To do this, drag 'date' and insert it into the rows, drag the 'mean temperature' into values.

As the tempratures do not need to be summed, this can be changed by right clicking on sum and change it to average instead.

To be able to visualise what's the information in the sum coloumn is telling, select the whole coloumn and insert a colour scale. This then shows visually which days were cold/colder and which days were the most hot/hottest.
