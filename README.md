# Weather dataset #

First download the weather dataset and open it on Excel.

Start from A1 cell and select all. Then click on insert and pivotchart.

Press ok then a new pivot chart will show on a new Excel tab.

Average mean temperatures will be looked at. This will show how the weather changes over a period over time. To do this, drag 'date' and insert it into the rows, drag the 'mean temperature' into values.

As the tempratures do not need to be summed, this can be changed by right clicking on sum and change it to average instead.

To be able to visualise what's the information in the sum coloumn is telling, select the whole coloumn and insert a colour scale. This then shows visually which days were cold/colder and which days were the most hot/hottest.

Instead of 'date,' if the 'month' filter is added in then you can see which month was the hottest and coldest too just by visually looking at the colour scale.

To show this trend more clearly, select the Average of Mean Temp coloumn and click on insert. Then find the Chart tab and insert in a line graph.

To format and remove unwanted buttons on the line graph, click on chart elements then untick the legend box. Once that is done, you can rename the title of the line graph.

To see which day saw the largest differences between the max and min temperature, month will be removed from the row filter and day will be inserted back in as well as average mean, minimum temperature and maximum temperature.

Then all the coloumns will be changed from sum to average.

Now a calculated field will be created by clicking on the calculated field button.

Now this has been created, you are able to see spread of any given date and month.
